# Naomi Carrigan

I am the founder of NHCarrigan, and my passion is building communities where technology isn’t just powerful—it’s ethical, inclusive, and welcoming to everyone.

I am a transfemme software engineer and community manager, and my experiences within the LGBT community have deeply shaped my determination to create safer, more supportive spaces in tech. I know what it feels like to be underestimated, excluded, or told that I don’t belong—and that’s why I fight so hard to make sure others never have to face those same barriers.

Through this company, I get to combine my love of technology with my belief in people. We build sustainable, ethical tools that help communities thrive, and we provide mentorship programs that give new developers—especially those from underrepresented groups—the guidance, support, and confidence they need to succeed.

At my core, I believe kindness and integrity should lead the way. My guiding principle is that technology should uplift, not divide. Whether I’m coding, mentoring, or organising events, my goal is always the same: to elevate marginalised voices, to create opportunities, and to make the tech world a little brighter and a lot more inclusive.

If you see me around—whether online, at a meetup, or in a mentoring session—please don’t hesitate to say hi. I’m always excited to meet new people, share stories, and learn from each other. After all, technology isn’t just about code—it’s about the communities we build with it.
